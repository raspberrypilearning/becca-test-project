## Creating your kit

In this step you'll design the basics of the kit, and can add a background too.

--- task ---
Delete the cat sprite and create a sports kit, you could choose a sprite, or draw with the paint tool.

We searched for "shirt".

--- task ---
Change the design to how you want it, and add your first colour with the fill tool. We used the gradient fill to make the costume colours pop!

Right click to duplicate the costume for each colour you want to use.

Create colour picker sprites for each costume - these could be squares, circles, or draw them freehand with the paint tool like we did. 

Name each costume after the colour

--- task ---

Add a broadcast message to each of the colour sprites. 

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
broadcast [pink]
``` 

--- /task ---


--- task ---
Add a receive block to kit sprite for each colour option you have

```blocks3
when I receive [pink]
switch costume to [pink]
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
We've used flags to decorate the kit. 

Create a flag sprite then duplicate and fill flag costumes in each colour. You might want to make the colours a bit different from the kit so that they stand out.
