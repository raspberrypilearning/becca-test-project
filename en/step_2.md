## Creating your kit

In this step you'll design the basics of the kit, and can add a background too.

--- task ---
Delete the cat sprite and create a sports kit, you could choose a sprite, or draw with the paint tool.

We searched for "shirt".

Change the design to how you want it, and add your first colour with the fill tool. We used the gradient fill to make the costume colours pop!

--- task ---
Right click to duplicate the costume for each colour you want to use.

Create colour picker sprites. These could be squares, circles, or draw them freehand with the paint tool. 

Duplicate a sprite, and change the fill for each colour. Then name them after the colour.

Add a `when sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"} block and add a `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} message to each of the colour sprites.

Name the new message after the colour. 

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
broadcast [blue]
``` 

--- /task ---


--- task ---
Add a `receive`{:class="block3events"} block that `switches`{:class="block3looks"} the kit costume for each colour

```blocks3
when I receive [blue]
switch costume to [blue]
```
